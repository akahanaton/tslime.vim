tslime.vim

My fork of https://github.com/jgdavey/tslime.vim

It adds some functionality, fixes some bugs, and adds docs.

" add these mapping to you ~/.vimrc
" send the whole file to the next tmux  pane, 
" buf will stop at the first meet of a blank line, need to be fix. Call this as "seed a block" then.
let g:tslime_normal_all_mapping = '<LocalLeader>aa'
" send the current line
let g:tslime_normal_line_mapping = '<LocalLeader>l'
" send the visual selection
let g:tslime_visual_mapping = '<LocalLeader>t'
let g:tslime_vars_mapping = '<LocalLeader>T'
